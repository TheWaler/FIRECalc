# FIRECalc

## Core Planned Features:

- Portfolio Tracking: Allow users to input and track the current value of their assets (stocks, crypto, etc.).
- Expense Input: Enable users to input expenses with different frequencies (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly) and convert them to annual expenses.
- Withdrawal Simulation: Implement different withdrawal strategies (e.g., fixed percentage, dynamic based on market conditions) to simulate financial independence outcomes. The simulations are based on user's portfolio and expenses.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Teal (#008080) for a sense of financial stability and growth.
- Secondary color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) for a clean and modern background.
- Accent: Gold (#FFD700) to highlight key metrics and interactive elements.
- Dashboard layout with clear sections for portfolio, expenses, and withdrawal strategy.
- Use financial-themed icons (e.g., stocks, money, graph) for visual clarity.
- Subtle transitions and animations for a smooth user experience.
